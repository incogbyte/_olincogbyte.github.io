      <description>This write up explains how i solved the challenge proposed by CakeCTF2022. The challenge was to get the flag in a binary made with the Nim (https://nim-lang.org/) program language.
tl;dr
If you want to know the answer right away, just put a break point in the sym.join_main_42 function, and check the registers and your flag will be there.
The challenge itself was not complex however, I had never written anything in Nim.</description>
