      <description>Hi everyone, in this blog i&amp;rsquo;m going to explain a little bit of my journey to solve a iOS challenge proposed by @as0ler. The Challenge can be found at the following link:
https://github.com/hexploitable/r2con2020_r2frida/blob/master/ios-challenge-2.ipa The challenge is to remove all anti-tamper methods, that means you will have to remove some methods such as:
ptrace sysctl strstr geppid In this blog, I will only talk about how I did it to bypass, using only frida with radare2.</description>

      <description>TL;DR
This write up is about a SQL injection which I found 4 days after another researcher reported it :/, however, because of the fact that I haven’t found any write ups or publicly available exploits, I decided to write about it. Exploit at the end!
PHPIPAM is a software widely used internally by several companies. And by being so, it is relatively common for you to find a running instance to manage IT /assets, networks, etc.</description>

      <description>HI, People In this basic tutorial, I want to show you a little bit of SQL Injection WAF bypass, I know it is a subject that is well commented and discussed every day .. after all, WAFS are boring :/ and in the end .. they just work as a superficial protection for an environment (in my opnion it is like a leaky bucket that you fix with bubble gum) .</description>

      <description>In this post i’ll describe how to bypass NAC ( Network Access Control ). During an internal pentest, I had a problem connecting to the client network ( all network devices 802.1x (including VoIP devices), after a few hours trying to find out why, I found out that the client had implemented NAC, but what is Network access protocol (NAC) ?
Network Access Control (NAC) is a solution used on corporate networks to prevent, or even hinder, unauthorized hosts from accessing internally available services and systems.</description>
